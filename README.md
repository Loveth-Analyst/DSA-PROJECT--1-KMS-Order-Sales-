 ## Project Objective
As a Business Intelligence Analyst to support the Abuja division of KMS.I analyze the KMS inventory and sales database with Excel file containing order data from 2009 to 2012 to answer key business questions, identify trends, detect inefficiencies, and support data-driven decision-making.

-- Kultra Mega Stores Inventory key objectives
1. Which product category had the highest sales?
2. What are the Top 3 and Bottom 3 regions in terms of sales?
3. What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario?
4. Advise the management of KMS on what to do to increase the revenue from the bottom

8. Which Corporate Customer placed the most number of orders in 2009 â€“ 2012?
9. Which consumer customer was the most profitable one?
10. Which customer returned items, and what segment do they belong to?
11. If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and
Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company
appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer

## Tools & Technologies

Microsoft SQL Server 

SQL (Joins,  Aggregations, queries)

## Dataset Description

The project uses multiple tables, including:

orders â€“ order details

customers â€“ customer information and segments

inventory â€“ product stock levels

sales â€“ transaction records

shipping â€“ delivery method and cost

returns â€“ returned items etc


## Key Analysis Performed

Identified top-selling and low-performing products

Analyzed returned items by customer and segment

Investigated shipping costs vs. delivery speed

Evaluated revenue contribution by region and order priority

Joined multiple tables to track full order lifecycle


## Business Insights

Express Air is the fastest but most expensive shipping method

Delivery Truck is the most economical but slowest

Certain customers consistently return products â€“ further investigation is recommended

Bottom 10 customers generate the least revenue â€“ targeted marketing may help

Order priority influences shipping method choice and cost efficiency


## Reflection

This project strengthened my ability to write complex SQL queries, join large tables, and interpret business insights from structured datasets.
